Welcome to OpenNetVM!
=====================================

OpenNetVM is a high performance NFV platform based on `DPDK <http://dpdk.org>`_ and `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ containers.  OpenNetVM provides a flexible framework for deploying network functions and interconnecting them to build service chains.

OpenNetVM is an open source version of the NetVM platform described in our `NSDI 2014 <http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/papers/14-NSDI-netvm.pdf>`_ and `HotMiddlebox 2016 <http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/papers/16-HotMiddlebox-onvm.pdf>`_ papers, released under the `BSD <https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ license.  

The `develop <https://github.com/sdnfv/OpenNetVM/tree/develop>`_ branch tracks experimental builds (active development) whereas the `master <https://github.com/sdnfv/OpenNetVM/tree/master>`_ branch tracks verified stable releases.  Please read our `releases </releases>`_ document for more information about our releases and release cycle.

You can find information about research projects building on `OpenNetVM <http://sdnfv.github.io/onvm/>`_ at the `UCR/GW SDNFV project site <http://sdnfv.github.io/>`_. OpenNetVM is supported in part by NSF grants CNS-1422362 and CNS-1522546. 

Notes
####################################

We have updated our DPDK submodule to point to a new version, v18.11. If you have already cloned this repository, please update your DPDK submodule by running:

   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init

And then rebuild DPDK using the install guide or running these commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   cd dpdk
   make config T=$RTE_TARGET
   make T=$RTE_TARGET -j 8
   make install T=$RTE_TARGET -j 8

See our release document for more information.

Installing
######################

To install OpenNetVM, please see the `OpenNetVM Installation <install>`_ guide for a thorough walkthrough.

Using OpenNetVM
#######################

OpenNetVM comes with several sample network functions.  To get started with some examples, please see the `Example Uses <examples>`_ guide

Creating NFs
########################

The `NF Development <nfdev>`_ guide will provide what you need to start creating your own NFs.

Dockerize NFs
#######################

NFs can be run inside docker containers, with the NF being automatically or hand started. For more informations, see our `Docker guide <docker>`_.

TCP Stack
