About
--
openNetVM is a high performance NFV platform based on [DPDK][dpdk] and [Docker][docker] containers.  openNetVM provides a flexible framework for deploying network functions and interconnecting them to build service chains.

openNetVM is an open source version of the NetVM platform described in our [NSDI 2014][nsdi14] and [HotMiddlebox 2016][hotmiddlebox16] papers, released under the [BSD][license] license.  

The [develop][dev] branch tracks experimental builds (active development) whereas the [master][mast] branch tracks verified stable releases.  Please read our [releases][rels] document for more information about our releases and release cycle.

You can find information about research projects building on [OpenNetVM][onvm] at the [UCR/GW SDNFV project site][sdnfv]. OpenNetVM is supported in part by NSF grants CNS-1422362 and CNS-1522546.
