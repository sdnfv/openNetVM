Pktgen Installation 
===================

#### Welcome to the installation guide for [Pktgen](https://pktgen-dpdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html). Pktgen is a high performance traffic generator app built on [DPDK](http://dpdk.org/).

This guide assumes that you already have openNetVM installed on your machine. If you do not, please follow the [ONVM installation guide](https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/blob/master/docs/Install.md). 

For further information regarding Pktgen configuration or set up, please refer to the [ONVM Pktgen Wiki page](https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/wiki/Packet-generation-using-Pktgen).

----------


1 Preparation Steps  
===================

1.1 Check if you have free hugepages
------------- 

`$grep -i huge /proc/meminfo`


Ensure that you have enough hugepage memory available by verifying that `HugePages_Free` is not equal to 0. If it is, you will likely need to reboot your machine, with `sudo reboot` to free hugepages. After a reboot, repeat this step. You may need to refer to the troubleshooting section of the ONVM install guide for if issues are persistent.
```
AnonHugePages:      2048 kB
HugePages_Total:    1024
HugePages_Free:       64
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
```

1.2 Check your current status of NIC binding and active status
------------- 

Pktgen requires that at least one 10Gb NIC port is bound to the DPDK driver at the time of use. 

You can check the status of your NICs with `./dpdk/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -s`.   
The desired NIC status should appear as such:  

```
Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
============================================
0000:07:00.0 '82599EB 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv=igb_uio unused=ixgbe
0000:07:00.1 '82599EB 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio

Network devices using kernel driver
===================================
0000:05:00.0 '82576 Gigabit Network Connection' if=eth0 drv=igb unused=igb_uio *Active*
```

Please refer to the troubleshooting section of the ONVM Install Guide for instructions on how to bind NIC cards to the DPDK driver. 


2 Installation of Pktgen 
===================

2.1 Get Package 
-------------

#### Initialize pktgen submodule   
`git submodule init`   
`git submodule update`

#### Install dependencies
pcap: `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`   
readline: `sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev` 

#### Install Lua

To install the latest version, you will need to download, extract and build the package from [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html).   
From your root directory:
```
cd ~/
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.5.tar.gz             
tar -zxf lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
cd lua-5.3.5
make linux test
sudo make install
```
To make sure the installation was successful, run `lua` in the command line. The output should be similar to 
```
$ lua
Lua 5.3.5, Copyright (C)1994-2017 Lua.org, PUC Rico
>
```
***Note:*** *Lua 5.3.5 may not be the latest version. Please visit [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html) for more information.*

2.2 Build Pktgen Application
------------- 

Enter working directory, and compile the application

`$cd tools/Pktgen/pktgen-dpdk/`

`$make`   

***Note:*** *Compilation of Pktgen may display errors regarding installation location of Lua. Please ignore.*

Test pktgen by running:

`$sudo ./app/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/pktgen -c 3 -n 1`

Updating configuration for pktgen, three servers are set up for observing the traffic flow: web client ----> port 0 - ONVM - port 1----> web server


2.3 Configure Pktgen for openNetVM
------------- 
1. Run the ONVM manager and retrieve the MAC address being used.

Pktgen script files are located in `openNetVM-Scripts`, found in the `tools/Pktgen` directory.   

2. In the `pktgen-config.lua` file, modify the MAC address to match that being used by the ONVM manager. Optionally, you may want to modify the src/dest ip as well. 

Further guidance on Pktgen configuration for ONVM can be found in [ONVM's Pktgen Wiki page](https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/wiki/Packet-generation-using-Pktgen). 

2.4 Run pktgen
------------- 

```sh
./openNetVM-Scripts/run-pktgen.sh 1
```   

If you got your result as below, then you are all set
```
