Pktgen Installation 
===================




#### Welcome to installation memo for [Pktgen](http://pktgen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), Pktgen is an app build on [DPDK](http://dpdk.org/),  which is a high performance traffic generator. 

This guide is assuming that you have already got openNetVM installed on your machine, if not, please follow installation guide for openNetVM in file ***INSTALL.md***. 

----------


1 Preparation Steps  
===================

1.1 Check if you have free hugepages
------------- 

`$grep -i huge /proc/meminfo`

If ***HugePages_Free*** 's value equals to 0, which means there is no free hugepages available, you probably have to reboot your machine, by `$sudo reboot` to get some released hugepages. After rebooting your computer please refer to installation guide for openNetVM step ***5*** for guiance of creating Hugepage directory and reserving memory.

```
AnonHugePages:      2048 kB
HugePages_Total:    1024
HugePages_Free:       64
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
```

1.2 Check your current status of NIC binding and active status
------------- 

If your 10G ports are binded with DPDK driver, you are fine, if not, please refer to installation guide openNetVM for instructions for unbinding NIC cards from kernal uio and rebinding to DPDK.  


```
Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
============================================
0000:07:00.0 '82599EB 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv=igb_uio unused=ixgbe
0000:07:00.1 '82599EB 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio

Network devices using kernel driver
===================================
0000:05:00.0 '82576 Gigabit Network Connection' if=eth0 drv=igb unused=igb_uio *Active*
```



2 Installation of Pktgen 
===================


2.1 Get Package 
-------------

Initialize pktgen submodule

`git submodule init && git submodule update`

Install pcap dependency

`sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`

`$sudo ./app/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/pktgen -c 3 -n 1`

Updating configuration for pktgen, three servers are set up for observing the traffic flow: web client ----> port 0 - ONVM - port 1----> web server


2.3 Configure pktgen for openNetVM
------------- 

Script files are located in openNetVM-Scripts

1. Modify mac and optionally src/dest ip in the `pktgen-config.lua`.

2.4 Run pktgen
