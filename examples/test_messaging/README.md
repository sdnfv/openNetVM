Test Messaging
==
This is an example NF that acts as a unit test for sending messsages from an NF to itself.
The NF runs the following unit tests:

 1. Send/Receive a single message and check for data correctness
 2. Send/Receive a batch of messages
 3. Send a batch of messages larger than the ring and verify there are no memory pool leaks
 
 Each test is allowed to run for a maximum of 5 seconds.
