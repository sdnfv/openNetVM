NFD NF
==

# About
NFD is a C++-based NF developing compiler designed by Wenfei's group (***http://wenfei-wu.github.io/***) from IIIS, Tsinghua University, China. <br>

NFD compiles the NF logic into common C++ program by using table-form language to model NFs' behavior . With NFD's help, NF developer, free from the problems that porting NFs into specific network environment or deploying platforms, can easily concentrate on designing NF's core logic. 
<br>
