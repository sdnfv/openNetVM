# Loads the uio kernel modules, shows NIC status
# CONFIGURATION (via environment variable):
#  - Ensure that $RTE_SDK and $RTE_TARGET are set (see install docs)
#  - Set ONVM_NIC to the name of the interface you want to bind (default p2p1)
#  - Can set ONVM_NIC_PCI to the PCI address of the interface (default 07:00.0)
